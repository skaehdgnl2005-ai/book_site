# Progress Log

## Handoff (resume here)   ← was session-handoff.md; consolidated to cut sync/drift (M4)
- Resume with: `./init.sh` → read this file + `git log --oneline -20` → pick top `passes:false`
  in `feature_list.json` (WIP=1) → `pnpm attempt <id>` before working it.
- Next action (single): **F003 done** (payment abstracted behind provider-agnostic
  `PaymentProvider`; TossPayments test adapter; env + check-constraints R1 + guardrails/approve
  re-pointed Stripe→Toss). Remaining **Wave 0**: F004 (DB+seed) · F029 (asset) · content F024–F028.
  Then Wave 1 (TRACK-CAT/TRACK-ORDER/TRACK-CUSTOM — TRACK-CUSTOM now unblocked by F003).
  Prompts: `docs/SESSION_PROMPTS.md`.
- Broken / not done: buyer-flow funnel (catalog→order→checkout) not built yet; F036/F037/etc. pending.
- Follow-up (Stripe→Toss residue, not a gate): `.github/workflows/ci.yml` still injects `STRIPE_*` env
  (harmless — those vars are optional and ignored; renaming needs the GitHub secrets renamed too, so it
  rides with the checkout track F012–F016), and prose docs `docs/SAFETY.md`/`CONSTRAINTS.md`/
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `eval/golden` still say "Stripe". `.env.example` was re-pointed in F003.

## Current verified state   ← single source of truth
- Last green `pnpm check`: **2026-06-01** (lint + typecheck + unit + 0 constraint violations, incl. R4/R5 invariants; F003 owns payments.test.ts: 13 + smoke.test.ts: 10 = 23 — total fluctuates while sibling Wave-0 tracks' db/pii tests sit uncommitted in the shared tree)
- E2E (`pnpm test:e2e`): **2 passed** (branded home — brand/hero/3 category cards/CTA; 375px no-overflow)
- Boots via `./init.sh`: **yes** (install → check → ready, exit 0)
- **Two honest, separate numbers** (`pnpm status`):
  - **Harness readiness** (machinery, product-agnostic): 85.2/100 → READY (see `SCORECARD.md`)
  - **Product delivery** (그림책 제작소 store): **3 / 32 product features passing (~9%)** — F002 home + F003 payment foundation
  - harness-track features passing: 6 / 10 (F030/F031 evidence refreshed Stripe→Toss)
- Bootstrap contract (build_guide §7): **MET** — boots, verified tests exist, AGENTS.md router, feature_list aligned.

## Status
Harness **INITIALIZED + review-hardened + repurposed to 그림책 제작소**. Spec layer (brief/schema/
feature_list/router) now reflects the real product; DESIGN.md (Atelier Sans) wired + enforced. Coding loop next.

## Session log (newest first)
### 2026-06-01 — F003 payment provider abstraction + Stripe→Toss re-point (TRACK-PAY)
- Built `src/lib/payments/`: provider-agnostic `PaymentProvider` contract (`index.ts`) + TossPayments
  **test/sandbox** adapter (`toss.ts`). KRW won = integer (no minor unit), enforced. `confirm()` uses an
  **injectable transport** so `pnpm check` stays hermetic (no network — parallels the DB rule, ADR-0002);
  maps Toss `DONE→PAID`, error→`FAILED`, `CANCELED→CANCELED`. Adapter refuses live keys (defence in depth).
- Re-pointed Stripe→Toss across the safety machinery: `env.ts` refuses a live Toss key (`live_sk_`/`live_ck_`)
  outside production + redacts Toss keys; `check-constraints` **R1** now flags Toss live keys (grouped regex so
  the rule's own source can't self-match — empirically verified it stays clean AND fires on a planted live key);
  `guardrails` IRREVERSIBLE_ACTIONS → `toss.charge.live`/`toss.refund.live` + `consultation.book`, with
  `scripts/approve.mjs` kept in sync (so the error messages' `pnpm approve toss.charge.live` is real).
- TDD: payments.test.ts (13) RED→GREEN first; smoke.test.ts Toss assertions (10) RED→GREEN. `pnpm check`
  green (lint+type+unit+constraints). F003 `passing` (R4 holds); F030/F031 evidence refreshed to Toss. attempt reset.
- Worker≠checker (ADR-0005/F042): ran a 5-dimension adversarial review (each finding independently
  verified). 5 real findings, all addressed: re-pointed `.env.example` to the Toss env contract; added tests
  for `confirm()`'s KRW guard, the env client-key live branch, and the legacy-Stripe redact branch; fixed a
  stale "Stripe webhook" comment in guardrails.ts. 1 dismissed (CI STRIPE_* env — harmless, deferred).
- Scope note: completing the rename meant touching `scripts/approve.mjs` (approval gate must know the renamed
  actions) and `.env.example` (dev-facing env contract) — both beyond the literal track file list but unowned
  by any sibling Wave-0 track (zero merge-conflict risk).
- Next: remaining Wave 0 (F004 DB, F029 asset, content F024–F028).

### 2026-06-01 — F002 branded home (pattern-setter) + runbook refinement
- Built the 그림책 제작소 branded home (hero + 3-category preview + primary CTA) and the reusable
  `src/app/_components/` kit (Nav, Footer, Button/CtaLink, SectionHeader, CategoryCard) — all styled
  from DESIGN.md tokens (component classes added to `globals.css`; R6/R7 clean).
- TDD: rewrote `home.spec.ts` first (brand/hero/3 cards/CTA + 375px). `pnpm check` green + E2E 2 passed
  → F002 `passing` (R4 holds), attempt reset.
- Refined `docs/SESSION_PROMPTS.md` per re-examination: default = single-session context-batch; subagent
  offload only for independent/mechanical tracks; stateful funnels stay in main (parallel sessions dropped).
- Next: Wave 0 (F003/F004/F029 + content F024–F028).

### 2026-06-01 — repurpose to 그림책 제작소 (spec layer) + DESIGN.md wiring
- Wired DESIGN.md (Atelier Sans) as UI SoR: tokens→`globals.css`, fonts→`layout.tsx`, refs (root +
  `src/app/AGENTS.md`), executable R6 (no box-shadow) / R7 (no pure #fff/#000). ADR-0008. Verified green.
- Replaced harness CONTENT, kept ENGINE: PRODUCT_BRIEF v2; schema (Template/Order/Personalization/
  CustomRequest/Consultation/Asset; KRW won; no inventory); feature_list (42 features, entry-line first);
  AGENTS.md router; ADR-0009.
- 3 decisions: TossPayments (provider-agnostic; Stripe swap scheduled as F003), web scope =
  commerce+intake+mypage (AI generation backstage / out of web scope), build order = entry line first.
- `src/` runtime untouched → `pnpm check` green (lint+typecheck+9 tests+constraints R1–R7 incl R4/R5 on 42 features).
- Next: coding loop. Foundations F004 ∥ F003 (parallel-safe), then F002 branded home.

### 2026-06-01 — review hardening (accepted design feedback)
- R4 invariant (`state:"passing"` ⟺ `passes:true`) + R5 executable termination (3 attempts → must be `blocked`)
  added to `pnpm constraints`; both tested (R5 fires + resets). Termination is now counted, not prose.
- `pnpm status`: honest dual metric (product delivery vs harness readiness) — anti-Goodhart.
- `feature_list.json` v2: every feature tagged `track: product|harness` (de-conflates store vs methodology).
- Consolidated `session-handoff.md` into this file (cut a per-session drift surface).
- `pnpm attempt <id>` ledger (`.harness/attempts.json`, committed) records attempts across sessions.

### 2026-06-01 — harness bootstrap (INITIALIZER)
- Done & verified: runnable Next.js 15 skeleton; `pnpm check` green; E2E home smoke 2 passed;
  tools (approve/constraints/eval); state + docs; fresh-clone typecheck robustness verified.
- Changed: whole repo (greenfield → harness). Broken: none (product features unimplemented by design).
